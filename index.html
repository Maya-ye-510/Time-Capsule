            <p>Hi! I am Maya, and this is my time capsule that I started on February 6th, 2026. It contains some of my favorite digital objects, 
                such as websites, playlists, and files with great importance to me.
                I can't imagine what will this website looks like after 15 years, as well as if I will 
                like the same music, comics, and artwork. However, in the meantime, feel free to explore and click on the different links!</p>
